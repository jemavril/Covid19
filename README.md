[Current covid19 status in India]
COVID-19 count reaches 43 in India; 3 cases reported on Monday ;
New Delhi: With three new cases confirmed on Monday in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Kerala the number of coronavirus cases have risen up to 43 in India.
Four new cases of COVID-19 have been reported since Sunday. This includes one from Ernakulam in Kerala, one from Delhi, one from Uttar Pradesh, and so on...
As we know the spread of the virus is increasing day by day, but what can be done inorder to bring it to control??? As we have heard the famous quote "Prevention is better than cure"... would be the best suggestion that would be practical.

[b.Ways to prevent it from becoming a prey to the virus]
In a public place like subway/metro, see to that you try to avoid touching  your eyes , nose and mouth as much as possible.
Wash your hands frequently
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain social distancing
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
