<h3><em> Causes and prevention of <span style="background-color: #914c53; color: #ffffff; padding: 0 3px;">covid 19 </span>
<p><strong>As we know day by day the virus is spreading either to another person, another country - due to lack of resources and knowledge people dont know how to react.So below are the details such as what is covid19, speculation regarding the theory, prevention</strong></p>
  <h2>What is coronavirus??? </h2>
  <p>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause disease in animals. Seven, including the new virus, have made the jump to humans, but most just cause cold-like symptoms.</p>
<p>
Two other coronaviruses – Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) – are much more severe, having killed more than 1,500 people between them since 2002.</p>
<p>
The new virus, officially called Covid-19, is also dangerous - s far, around 20 per cent of confirmed cases have been classed as severe or critical. So far, around 15 to 20 per cent of hospital cases have been classed as "severe" and the current death rate varies between 0.7 per cent and 3.4 per cent depending on the location and, crucially, access to good hospital care.
  </p>
  
  <h2>How did the outbreak start?</h2>
     <p>The source of the coronavirus is believed to be a "wet market" in Wuhan which sold both dead and live animals including fish and birds. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Such markets pose a heightened risk of viruses jumping from animals to humans because hygiene standards are difficult to maintain if live animals are being kept and butchered on site. Typically, they are also densely packed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The animal source of the latest outbreak has not yet been identified, but the original host is thought to be bats. Bats were not sold at the Wuhan market but may have infected live chickens or other animals sold there. </p>
<p>
Bats are host to a wide range of zoonotic viruses including Ebola, HIV and rabies.

<p>Here are 10 things you can do to prevent COVID-19:
  <li>Clean your hands regularly – wash with soap and water, or clean with alcohol-based hand rub 
    <li>Clean surfaces regularly with disinfectant – for example kitchen benches and work desks;
      <li>Educate yourself about COVID-19. Make sure your information comes from reliable sources;
        <li>Avoid traveling if you have a fever or cough, and if you become sick while on a flight, inform the crew immediately. Once you get to your destination, make contact with a health professional and tell them about where you have been;
          <li>Cough or sneeze into your sleeve. If using a tissue, dispose of the tissue immediately into a closed rubbish bin, and then clean your hands;
            <li>Take extra precautions to avoid crowded areas if you are over 60 years old, or if you have an underlying condition;
              <li>If you feel unwell, stay at home and call your doctor or local health professional;
                <li>If you are sick, stay at home, and eat and sleep separately from your family, use different utensils and cutlery to eat;If you develop shortness of breath, call your doctor and seek care immediately;
                  <li>It’s normal and understandable to feel anxious, especially if you live in a country that has been affected. Find out what you can do in your community. Discuss how to stay safe in your workplace, school or place of worship.
